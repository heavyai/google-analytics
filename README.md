## Workflow of the OmniSci-Google Analytics Application

This application is written in Python and based on the original work from
Ryan Praski http://www.ryanpraski.com/python-google-analytics-api-unsampled-data-multiple-profiles/
and Google Developerâ€™s Hello Analytics API: Python quickstart for service accounts sample program.

Here is what the application does:
Create a service object to Google Analytics using the client_secrets.json file corresponding to the service account
that was created in the prerequisite step. Traverse the Google Analytics management hierarchy and construct the
mapping of website profile views and IDs. Prompt the user to select the profile view they would like to collect the data.
